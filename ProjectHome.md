Java library and programs for controlling a [Silicondust HDHomeRun](http://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun) (networked digital TV tuner).

Status: Still working on cleaning up the original code, and checking in classes as they get nearer to ready.

I use Eclipse for development, but am thinking about using Maven for build support (so that others can easily download and build the library, tests and apps).
